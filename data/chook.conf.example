# Default: true
#
concurrency: true

#################
# The directory holding the internal and external handlers.

# Default: none
#
webhooks_user:

#################
# When 'HTTP Basic Authentication' is enabled by setting webhooks_user, this
# tells chook how to learn the password for that user:
#
# - If its a path to a file, the file contains the password and nothing else.
#   The file must be owned by the user running the chook server, and must have
#   mode 0600.
#
# - If it ends with a pipe character (|), everything execpt the pipe is considered
#   to be a shell command, executable by the user running the chook server.
#   The standard-output of the command will be the password.
#
# Default: none
